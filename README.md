# League Cure

A silly little project to close League of Legends as soon as the exe detects it's running. I was thinking about playing League when doing it.

Only download the .exe if you want to actually leave league or try modifying the py to close other programs.

DO NOT use this with malicious intentions, pls.
I won't take any responsability of what could happen to your pc if so.

# Advice

As this is an unsigned exe, windows will recognize it as a virus, it is not. In your windows defender add it to the exclusions and you're ready to go :D

Happy LoLn't
